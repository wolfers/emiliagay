## What to do with this website

I am very sleepy as I write this in the backroom at work. I got here early and will likely have to finish writing this whole thing later. I don't really have any good ideas of what I want to do with this website.

I've considered just posting screenshots from ffxiv, gunpla builds, and other random things I work on. Especially since twitter is dying, I got banned from tiktok for being too young, and I don't really wnat to use another social media account.

I could also just focus on making this a palce to put all of my future programming projects. It will probably be a long time before I really have anything interesting to show. I might write a blog post about how things hav egone for me in general, but who knows.

## I Am Bad At Blog Posts

What do I even do, I'm too autistic for this. I guess I jsut don't have anything to say that I think is worth writing down. Especially right now. Maybe I'll have more as I find things to post stuff about. Who knows.

## ANYWAYS BYE FOR NOW UWU
